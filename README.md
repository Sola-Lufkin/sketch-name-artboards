### Name Artboards
Goes through each artboards and creates a text label where the artboard name sits so it is visible when exporting with slices.
![Creates 'temp' labels per artboard at the size and position of the natively rendered artboard names](http://cl.ly/image/3W0X450T1v1z/Image%202014-06-25%20at%2012.14.49%20PM.png)

If you move / change artboard names, just re-run the plugin and it will replace the old 'Artboard labels' group with a new one!
