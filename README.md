### Name Artboards
Goes through each artboards and creates a text label where the artboard name sits so it is visible when exporting with slices.

If you move / change artboard names, just re-run the plugin and it will replace the old 'Artboard labels' group with a new one! Careful not to have other groups with the same name â€” it will be erased.

## V1.2
Now also draws a slice around all visible layers/artboards named 'Slice'. There's a checkbox in the prompt that allows you to toggle this.
